Trying to save a setting (with an user inside)

Currently I have the error: `ERROR: null value in column "dropcontact_api_key" violates not-null constraint` but It looks like I am settint everything properly... maybe something related to Lombok?

Also I think I need to understand EntityManager to save entities properly: https://www.javaguides.net/2018/12/different-ways-to-update-jpa-entity-objects-into-database.html 

# Nice to Have
- Learn how to generate a UUID automatically (by now I removed the not null constraint in the sql script)
- learn HAL and define api with swagger to define the API.
- Shape API for our needs
- Auth in Spring (API based)
