## Current issue

````java
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'entityManagerFactory' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaConfiguration.class]: Could not determine recommended JdbcType for `com.oman.campaign.Campaign`
````

I got an error in Campaigns. I think is something related to one to many relation.
