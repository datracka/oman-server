# TODO

## Very Next

- [ ] replace @NonNull from `springframework.lang.NonNull` with @NotNull from `spring-boot-starter-validation` (add dependency)

## Next

- [ ] Define API (Settings / Users). 
  - https://github.com/khoubyari/spring-boot-rest-example/tree/master
  - 
- [ ] Create DTOS and services following this example
https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781803243214/7/ch07lvl1sec37/adding-models

- [ ] I wanted to add swagger directly in amigo project, but not possible


### Interesting lectures

API Error handling 

https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application-development/9781788475891/10/ch10lvl1sec43/building-a-rest-client

Also I think I need to understand EntityManager to save entities properly: https://www.javaguides.net/2018/12/different-ways-to-update-jpa-entity-objects-into-database.html 

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/jpa-entitymanager-hibernate

also, interesting how it works with 

- Controllers
- Services
- Dtos -> maybe a bit of refresh about DTOs in Java :)

Spring Boot microservices lecture:

# Nice to Have
- Learn how to generate a UUID automatically (by now I removed the not null constraint in the sql script)
- learn HAL and define api with swagger to define the API.
- Shape API for our needs
- Auth in Spring (API based)
